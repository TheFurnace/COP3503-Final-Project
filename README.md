# COP3503-Final-Project
Final group project for COP 3503

Analysis:
Upon opening our software, user will be able to select a directory
with the location of their existing music library, or where they would
like their library to be saved. The music player will then populate
the library with music files found in the directory. Program will then
display the library sorted by date added by default, this can be
changed by the user to sort by any of the metadata. From here the user
can choose to play any of the songs by double-clicking on it, or by
highlighting the song and right-clicking the play button. Right
clicking will open a context menu providing several options for
playing or organizing music. Sidebars will include more organization
features like playlists and filter trees, as well as more information
about the track playing. The central buffer will contain the music
library/playlist being viewed, along the top will be all control
buttons for playing the music.

Design:
